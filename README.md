# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_BRAZILIAN_ECOMMERCE_DATA
I have done a Power BI dashboard analysis of Brazilian e-commerce data, highlighting key trends and insights. It shows that 97.02% of orders were delivered, while 1.11% were shipped, with other statuses including canceled and processing. The data tracks orders from January 2017 to July 2018, revealing a decline in sales post-2018. A total of 99K orders across 72 product categories were analyzed, segmented by customer state. Payment methods and customer reviews were also examined to identify trends and areas for improvement. Recommendations include reviving sales through promotions, enhancing payment options with UPI and digital wallets, leveraging customer reviews, focusing on top-selling products with personalized pricing, and streamlining logistics and inventory management for improved efficiency.
